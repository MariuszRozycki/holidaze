## Overview

Holidaze is a modern front-end application for an accommodation booking platform. The project is being developed using **HTML**, **SCSS**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and **TypeScript**. It leverages **GitHub Pages** for hosting and integrates a **Kanban board on GitHub Projects** for task management. The design prototype was created in **Adobe XD**.

The application consists of two main sections:

1. **Customer-facing website**: Users can browse, search, and book venues for their holidays.
2. **Admin-facing dashboard**: Venue managers can register, manage venues, and oversee bookings.

This project integrates with the Holidaze API for backend functionality, focusing solely on the development of the front end.
